Encrypt is a python script that encrypts a string using a key from 1-9.

Decrypt decrypts that string with that same key.

EncryptDecrypt puts both in the same package.

Please note that this is a demonstration that only rotates the letters by the number specified by the key. Do not use this to encrypt any serious data. I do not claim responsibility for data lost while using this script.
