Encrypt is a python script that encrypts a string using a key from 1-9.

Decrypt decrypts that string with that same key.

EncryptDecrypt puts both in the same package.

Please note that all this does is rotate the letters by the number specified by the key. Do not use this to encrypt any serious data.
